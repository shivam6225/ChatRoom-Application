Socket.io and HarperDB was used to build this full stack, real-time chat application with chat rooms that can be accessed by anybody on the internet.

This project is to develop a chat system based on JavaScript, React and Network concepts.
Normally, using HTTP requests, the server cannot push data to the client in real time. But using Socket.io, the server is able to push real time information to the client about some events that happened on the server.
