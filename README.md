InstaChat Forum is simple chat room application using web sockets.

The main objective of this simple chat room project is to create a chat application which helps different users to communicate with each other through a server connected.

This is a simple chat program with a server and can have many clients.

The server needs to be started first and clients can be connected later.

Simple Chat room provides a bidirectional communication between client and server. 

It enables users to seamlessly communicate with each other. The user has an option to login to the chatroom.

Socket.io and HarperDB was used to build this full stack, real-time chat application with chat rooms that can be accessed by anybody on the internet.

This project is to develop a chat system based on JavaScript, React and Network concepts.
Normally, using HTTP requests, the server cannot push data to the client in real time. But using Socket.io, the server is able to push real time information to the client about some events that happened on the server.

1) Frontend - React : React is a JavaScript library for buulding user interfaces. It is used to build single-page applications. It also allows us to create reusuable UI components.
2) Backend - Node and Express
<br>👉 Express : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develeop web and mobile applications.
<br>👉 Node : Node.js is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. It is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the server.
3) Database : HarperDB : a data plus application platform that allows you to query data using either SQL or NoSQL. HarperDB also has a build-in API, saving us from having to write a lot of backend code.
4) Real-Time communication : Socket.io : It allows the server to push information to the client in real time, when events occur on the server.
